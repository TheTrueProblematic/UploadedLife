      <p class="intro-paragraph">Uploaded Life drops you into Alex’s life the moment everything shifts online. Each month arrives as a scenario and every choice pushes Alex’s finances and happiness in a new direction.</p>
      <p class="intro-paragraph">Bills automatically remove $1,000 every turn, but Alex’s job, hobbies, and relationships can add or subtract cash and joy. You only see the story consequences—never the exact numbers—until the end of each month.</p>
      <p class="intro-paragraph">Modern services constantly demand ID uploads. Every time Alex hands over documents, that service is logged. The more IDs collected and the more months that pass, the higher the risk of identity theft.</p>
      <p class="intro-paragraph">If ID theft triggers, Alex’s accounts are wiped, debt explodes, and all perks disappear. If happiness hits zero, everything freezes and the run ends. Either way, you can always try again from a fresh starting point.</p>
      <p class="intro-paragraph">Keep Alex afloat, balance happiness against cash flow, and think twice before handing sensitive data to every app. When you are ready, step into the first month.</p>
